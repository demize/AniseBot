# AniseBot

This is, effectively, just a test bot for [liquorice](https://github.com/demize/liquorice).

It'll eventually be the base for another bot or two, but at present it's just to help develop the library :)

The canonical source for this is on my [gitolite](https://gitweb.msvcrt.zip/gitweb.cgi?p=AniseBot.git) but it's mirrored to Github as well.
This uses a janky action I modified and a janky post-receive hook I wrote and hopefully works reliably...
